"""
Enhanced OSC Client for Behringer Wing with auto-reconnect and state machine.

Wraps WingClient and adds:
- Connection state machine (DISCONNECTED → CONNECTING → CONNECTED → RECONNECTING)
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Message send/receive statistics
- Structured logging of connection events
